This section provides a step-by-step tutorial for the :doc:`./case_study`.

.. note::
    
    Input data files to be imported into the MONGKIE in this tutorial were generated by the :download:`extractAlteredNet_GBM.R </assets/extractAlteredNet_GBM.R>`. Refer to :doc:`./case_study` for details about the method. Briefly, starting with somatic mutations, CNAs, and gene expression data sets downloaded from `UCSC Cancer Browser <https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/proj/site/hgHeatmap/#?bookmark=ce15f29a905207cbf3d0dbcdf9d35c18>`_, the :download:`R script </assets/extractAlteredNet_GBM.R>` does the following tasks.
    
    * Calculate expression log2FCs of each gene in normal vs. tumor conditions.
    * Calculate expression means of each gene in 4 GBM subtypes.
    * Extract a sub-network of altered (somatic mutation or CNV) genes in `STRING <http://string-db.org/>`_.
    * Calculate expression correlations between each pair of genes in the extracted network.
    * Write vertices, edges, and expression related data files.
    
    You can download the R script and generated input files in :download:`supplementary_data.zip </assets/supplementary_data.zip>`.

Import a GBM-altered network
============================

To import a GBM-altered network from 2 CSV files for nodes and edges respectively,

#. Select ``File - Import - Comma-Separated Values (CSV)``, then a wizard window will guide you to remaining steps.

    .. image:: ./images/import_csv_menu.png
    
#. Choose :download:`tcga_gbm_vertices.csv </assets/tcga_gbm_vertices.csv>`, set ``ID column`` to ``name``, ``Label column`` to ``hgnc_symbol``, then click the ``Next`` button.

    .. image:: ./images/import_node_table_step.png
    
#. Choose :download:`tcga_gbm_edges.csv </assets/tcga_gbm_edges.csv>`, set ``Source column`` to ``from``, ``Target column`` to ``to``, then click the ``Finish`` button.

    .. image:: ./images/import_edge_table_step.png
    
#. A report dialog finally shows the summary of the imported graph, including number of nodes and edges, type of graph, issues occurred during the importing process etc. Click the ``OK`` button.
