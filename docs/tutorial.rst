This page provides a step-by-step tutorial for the :doc:`./case_study`.

.. note::
    
    Input data files that are used in this tutorial were generated by a :download:`extractAlteredNet_GBM.R </assets/extractAlteredNet_GBM.R>`. Refer to :doc:`./case_study` for details about the method. Briefly, starting with somatic mutations, CNAs, and gene expression data sets downloaded from `UCSC Cancer Browser <https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/proj/site/hgHeatmap/#?bookmark=ce15f29a905207cbf3d0dbcdf9d35c18>`_, the :download:`R script </assets/extractAlteredNet_GBM.R>` does the following tasks.
    
    * Extract a sub-network of altered (somatic mutation or CNV) genes in `STRING <http://string-db.org/>`_.
    * Calculate expression correlations between each pair of genes.
    * Calculate expression log2FCs of each gene in normal vs. tumor conditions.
    * Calculate expression means of each gene in 4 GBM subtypes.
    * Write vertices, edges, and expression related data files.
