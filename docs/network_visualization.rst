Network Visualization
*********************

Like other network visualization tools, MONGKIE also provides basic graph representations (See :doc:`network_visualization/visual_representation`) and many interactive ways to explore or edit a network, including Visual Editor UI, and Data-to-Visual Mapping (See :doc:`network_visualization/visual_editing`), zooming, filtering, searching (See :doc:`network_visualization/exploring_network`), and various graph layouts (See :doc:`network_visualization/graph_layouts`) etc. Furthermore, we implemented extended models for visualization of more complicated or interwoven biochemical reactions that can be multi-modal or hyper-graphs (:ref:`Saraiya et al., 2005 <Sara05>`) involving more than two sub-components, therefore basic graph representations failed to model, for example, formation of protein complexes, interactions controlled by others (See :doc:`network_visualization/pathway_visualization`).
