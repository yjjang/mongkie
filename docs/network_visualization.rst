Network Visualization
*********************

Like other network visualization tools, MONGKIE also provides basic graph representations (:doc:`See 4.1 <network_visualization/visual_representation>`) and many interactive ways to explore or edit a network, including Visual Editor UI, and Data-to-Visual Mapping (:doc:`See 4.3 <network_visualization/visual_editing>`), zooming, filtering, searching (:doc:`See 4.4 <network_visualization/exploring_network>`), and various graph layouts (:doc:`See 4.5 <network_visualization/graph_layouts>`) etc. Furthermore, we implemented extended models for visualization of more complicated or interwoven biochemical reactions that can be multi-modal or hyper-graphs (:ref:`Saraiya et al., 2005 <Sara05>`) involving more than two sub-components, therefore basic graph representations failed to model, for example, formation of protein complexes, interactions controlled by others (:doc:`See 4.2 <network_visualization/pathway_visualization>`).
