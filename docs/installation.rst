Java
^^^^

MONGKIE is written in Java, and runs on the Java Runtime Environment. Therefore, the Java runtime (7 or 8) is required to install and run it. You can download the latest version of Java runtime from `here <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ for Windows and Linux, and OS X Lion (10.7), Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9).

The tested Java versions are Java ``8`` and ``7u67`` for Windows, Linux, and OS X.

.. caution::
	MONGKIE cannot be installed or run using Java 6.0, and `OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/>`_ is not supported, be sure to run the official Java version from `Oracleâ€™s website <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_.

.. _user-directories:

User Directories
----------------

``userdir`` is the directory where MONGKIE stores user configuration data such as window layouts, and various application options. Sometimes your ``userdir`` can be corrupted and this results in the MONGKIE behaving weirdly.

To fix such issues, delete ``userdir`` entirely, then restart MONGKIE, and allow it to generate a new ``userdir`` from scratch. In most cases, this should repair the problems.

``userdir`` is located in:

* On Windows 2K/XP, :file:`C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Application Data\\.mongkie`
* On Windows Vista or later, :file:`C:\\Users\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\.mongkie`
* On OS X, :file:`/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/mongkie`
* On Linux, :file:`/home/<username>/.mongkie`
