Especially in tumor biology, integration of mutation, copy number, and gene expression profiles with gene interaction networks has been proposed as an approach to identify functional driver mutations, relying on the assumption that they will cluster on the network (Bertrand _et al._ 2015).\r\n\r\nMONGKIE is an integrated network analysis and visualization application mainly designed for such analyses, providing not only the **sophisticated visualization model** but also seamless integration of various analytical processes including **biological network integration, extraction and build of context specific sub-network, network clustering, gene expression overlay, and GO or pathway over-representation analysis**. \r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Visit <http://yjjang.github.io/mongkie> for details.\r\n    Copyright (C) 2011 Ewha Research Center for Systems Biology (ERCSB)\r\n    \r\n    MONGKIE is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n    \r\n    MONGKIE is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
