Especially in tumor biology, integration of mutation, copy number, and gene expression profiles with gene interaction networks has been proposed as an approach to identify functional driver genes and core gene modules perturbed by them, relying on the assumption that they will cluster on the network (Bertrand _et al._ 2015).\r\n\r\nMONGKIE is an integrated network analysis and visualization application mainly designed for such analyses, providing not only the `sophisticated visualization models`, but also seamless integration of various analytical processes including `network clustering`, `gene expression overlay`, and `GO over-representation analysis`.\r\n\r\nVideo Demo\r\n----------\r\n\r\nHERE\r\n\r\n#### Input data files used in the demo \r\n* ESC.graphml\r\n* ESC_total_node.csv\r\n* ESC_total_relation.csv\r\n* exp.csv\r\n* GSE15355.csv\r\n* symbol2uniprot.csv (should be imported as a node attribute before the GO enrichment analysis)\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSee [Installation](http://mongkie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) for details.\r\n\r\n1.
