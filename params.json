However integrated analysis of multi-omics data is quite complicated and can hardly be done in a fully automated way. Thus, *a powerful interactive visual mining tool* is much needed in analyzing a huge amount of heterogeneous data such as the [TCGA](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) projects.\r\n\r\n**M**ONGKIE is an application that integrates *network visualization* with *data analysis tools* in a single platform. The visualization unit supports sophisticated models for describing biological networks as well as various visualization options (e.g. `Data-to-Visual mapping` and `Gene expression overlay`) for displaying multi-omics data. In addition, we implemented in-house tools for network analysis including `Network clustering` and `Over-representation analysis`.\r\n\r\nVideo Demo\r\n----------\r\n\r\nHERE\r\n\r\n#### Data files used in the demo \r\n* [ESC.graphml](data/ESC.graphml)\r\n* [ESC_total_node.csv](data/ESC_total_node.csv)\r\n* [ESC_total_relation.csv](data/ESC_total_relation.csv)\r\n* [exp.csv](data/exp.csv)\r\n* [GSE15355.csv](data/GSE15355.csv)\r\n* [symbol2uniprot.csv](data/symbol2uniprot.csv) (should be imported as a node attribute before the GO enrichment analysis)\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSee [Installation](http://mongkie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) for details.\r\n\r\n1.
