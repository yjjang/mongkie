It is designed for both the visualization of biological networks and the analysis of these networks with a seamless integration between the two procedures. MONGKIE incorporates knowledge integration and network analysis modules into the visualization platform, such as Import and Export, Interaction Manager, Gene ID Conversion, Expression Overlay, Network Clustering, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GO and Pathway), Pathway Integration and Visualization.\r\nMONGKIE, including documentation, tutorials and developer guides, is available at [http://mongkie.org](http://mongkie.org)\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Visit <http://www.mongkie.org> for details about MONGKIE.\r\n    Copyright (C) 2011 Korean Bioinformation Center(KOBIC)\r\n    \r\n    MONGKIE is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n    \r\n    MONGKIE is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
